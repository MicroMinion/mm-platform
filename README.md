# FlunkyPaaS

This is the module that binds together all Flunky platform components

Currently, it is only tested on NodeJS but the goal is to make this also work in chrome apps, cordova apps (and potentially the browser later on).

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

Currently there is a test program that you can run to experiment with the platform. It requires that a directory server is running on the localhost. See paas-directory repository on how to set this up

```bash
./scripts/test-directory
```
